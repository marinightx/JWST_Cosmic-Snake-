# Objective

The objective was to study star formation in a distant galaxy using publicly available archival data from the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). The work involved the reduction and calibration of galaxy data, as well as their appropriate formatting. 
In an innovative approach, data analysis tools from the MUSE instrument, used with the Very Large Telescope (VLT), were adapted and applied to the NIRSpec instrument (designed to observe celestial objects in the near-infrared and onboard the JWST) to measure and analyze the flux of prominent emission lines. 
This approach provided accurate information on the chemical composition of the studied galaxy, as well as the physical processes taking place within it.
